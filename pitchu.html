                <h1>Description</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Machu Picchu, often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas," is an ancient Incan citadel located high in the Andes Mountains of Peru. 
                    Situated at an altitude of approximately 7,970 feet (2,430 meters), this UNESCO World Heritage Site is renowned for its breathtaking scenery and remarkable archaeological significance. 
                    Believed to have been built in the 15th century during the reign of Emperor Pachacuti, Machu Picchu served as a royal estate and a religious site, 
                    showcasing the advanced engineering and architectural skills of the Inca civilization.<br>
                    <br>

                    The site is characterized by its sophisticated dry-stone construction, with structures that have stood the test of time despite the region's seismic activity. 
                    The most iconic feature of Machu Picchu is the Intihuatana stone, often referred to as the "Hitching Post of the Sun." This ritual stone is believed to have been used by the Incas for astronomical 
                    observations and religious ceremonies, highlighting their deep connection to the cosmos. The layout of the citadel includes agricultural terraces, residential areas, 
                    and temples, all meticulously integrated into the surrounding landscape.<br><br>
                    
                    Machu Picchu was largely forgotten by the outside world until its rediscovery in 1911 by American historian Hiram Bingham. His expedition brought international attention to the site, leading to 
                    increased interest in Incan history and culture. Since then, Machu Picchu has become one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world, attracting millions of visitors each year who come
                     to marvel at its beauty and historical significance. The journey to the site can be undertaken via the Inca Trail, a multi-day trek that offers stunning views of the Andes and the opportunity to 
                     experience the rich biodiversity of the region.<br><br>
                    
                     The preservation of Machu Picchu has become a priority due to the impact of tourism and environmental factors. Efforts are underway to protect the site from erosion and damage while ensuring 
                     that visitors can appreciate its historical and cultural value. The Peruvian government has implemented measures to regulate visitor access and promote sustainable tourism practices, recognizing 
                     the importance of preserving this extraordinary heritage for future generations.<br><br>

                     Today, Machu Picchu stands as a testament to the ingenuity and resilience of the Inca civilization. It is not only a remarkable archaeological site but also a symbol of Peru's rich cultural heritage.
                      The breathtaking views, intricate stonework, and profound historical significance make Machu Picchu a must-visit destination for travelers and history enthusiasts alike, offering a glimpse into the 
                      remarkable achievements of the Inca Empire and the enduring legacy of their civilization.<br>
